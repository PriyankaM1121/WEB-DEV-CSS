    <h1>THOR</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Thor (from Old Norse: Þórr) is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In
      Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding god associated with lightning,
      thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of
      humankind, hallowing, and fertility. Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity
      occurs in Old English as Thunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, in Old Saxon as
      Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, all ultimately stemming from the
      Proto-Germanic theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.

    <h3>Name</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The name Thor is derived from Norse mythology. Its medieval Germanic
      equivalents or cognates are Donar (Old High German), Þunor (Old English),
      Thuner (Old Frisian), Thunar (Old Saxon), and Þórr (Old Norse),[2] the
      latter of which inspired the form Thor. Though Old Norse Þórr has only one
      syllable, it too comes from an earlier, Proto-Norse two-syllable form
      which can be reconstructed as *Þunarr and/or *Þunurr (evidenced by the
      poems Hymiskviða and Þórsdrápa, and modern Elfdalian tųosdag 'Thursday'),
      through the common Old Norse development of the sequence

    <h3>Historical attestations</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Roman era</h4>
    <p>
      The earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans,
      and in these works Thor is frequently referred to – via a process known as
      interpretatio romana (where characteristics perceived to be similar by
      Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) – as
      either the Roman god Jupiter (also known as Jove) or the Greco-Roman god
      Hercules.
